# jclass
Library for building class files with C
Most functions have the same name as their JVM assembly counterpart with the exceptions of drem (j_drem) and ldiv (j_ldiv) because one of the std C libs have those defined

[jclass wiki](https://github.com/hydrophobis/jclass/wiki/Home) (WIP)

Doesnt have any dependencies other than the std C lib
